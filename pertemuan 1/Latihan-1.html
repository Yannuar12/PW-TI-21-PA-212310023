    <P> <span><b>Bondan</b></span> is the moniker of Baskara Putra, also known as the vocalist and songwriter/producer of Indonesian music group <b>.Feast</b>.  
        After releasing both of the band’s heavily polarized <b>MULTIVERSES</b> (2017) and <b>Beberapa Orang Memaafkan</b> (2018), Bondan

        Salju Di Sini</b> (2018). Some might say the ‘true’ start of his own solo career is through the release of <b>Respect</b> in March 2019,  
        which was then suceeded by a constant stream of singles such as <b>Respect</b>, <b>Rlg</b> (ft. <b>Matter Mos</b> ),  
        <b>Unity</b> (ft. <b>For All</b> ), <b>Rispect And Unity For All</b> and <b>Misteri Cinta</b> , which are all part of Bondan’s debut album  
        titled <b>Unity</b> (November 2019), then included in 2019 album of the year lists by many Indonesian media and publications  
        such as Billboard Indonesia, Kompas, Tempo and Pop Hari Ini. Amassing more than 1 million monthly listeners on Spotify alone in less than nine  
        months, <span>Bondan</span>
